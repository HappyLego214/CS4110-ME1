Reaction Paper: Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)

Alan Turing’s essay, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," is pretty much a classic in AI. In it, Turing asks the big question, “Can machines think?” and introduces the famous Turing Test, which checks if a machine can pass as human in conversation. The test is simple but kind of genius because it focuses on what we can actually observe rather than trying to define intelligence.

Turing also handles some objections people had, like the idea that only humans can think because they have souls. He shuts that down pretty quickly, but his optimism that machines would be thinking by 2000 feels off now. We’re still not quite there yet. AI is good at mimicking humans, but it’s debatable if they really understand anything.

The Turing Test is still talked about today, but it’s not perfect. Just because a machine can trick someone doesn’t mean it actually gets what it’s saying. Plus, Turing didn’t dive into other types of intelligence like creativity, which are a big deal in AI research now.

Overall, even though some of his ideas are outdated, Turing was way ahead of his time. His paper laid the foundation for a lot of what we do in AI today, and the questions he raised are still super relevant.
